The Jindal School of Management conducts an Exit Survey every semester. This survey is important due to a lot of factors, some of them listed below:

- Since the prime method of recruitment is 'word of mouth' for the school, the feedback of these 'new alums' is important.
- It also helps us gauge ourselves across important areas like Advising, Career Management Center, etc.
- This also gives us a clear idea about what is working and what is not for the students.
- Finally it helps us determine who the Promotors and Detractors are and in what numbers.

### Net Promotor Score

NPS stands for Net Promoter Score which is a metric used in customer experience programs. NPS measures the loyalty of customers to a company. NPS scores are measured with a single-question survey and reported with a number from the range -100 to +100, a higher score is desirable.

NPS® is often held up as the gold standard customer experience metric. First developed in 2003 by Bain and Company, it’s now used by millions of businesses to measure and track how they’re perceived by their customers. NPS scores determine segmenting between poor and positive feedback.

It measures customer perception based on one simple question:

# "How likely is it that you would recommend [Organization X/Product Y/Service Z] to a friend or colleague?"

Respondents give a rating between 0 (not at all likely) and 10 (extremely likely) and, depending on their response, customers fall into one of 3 categories to establish an NPS score:

- Promoters respond with a score of 9 or 10 and are typically loyal and enthusiastic customers.
- Passives respond with a score of 7 or 8. They are satisfied with your service but not happy enough to be considered promoters.
- Detractors respond with a score of 0 to 6. These are unhappy customers who are unlikely to buy from you again, and may even discourage others from buying from you.

### Sense of belonging

It is important for us to know how our students feel when they graduate from the school. This particularly has a major role in their ability to come back to the school to contribute. This affects future relationships and hence is stressed up a lot. We do see that 36.18% of the students had a **Moderate Sense of Belonging**, whereas 26.81% had a **Strong Sense of Belonging**
