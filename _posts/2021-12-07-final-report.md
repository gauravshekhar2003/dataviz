The University of Texas at Dallas Naveen Jindal School of Management is the largest of UT Dallas’ eight schools, with over 9,000 students, almost half of whom are graduate students.
The school provides outstanding tuition value, a wide variety of classes on campus and online, flexible scheduling and a convenient location easily accessed from U.S. Highway 75 (Central Expressway), the President George Bush Turnpike and Dallas North Tollway.

The Jindal School of Management conducts an Exit Survey every semester. This survey is important due to a lot of factors, some of them listed below:

- Since the prime method of recruitment is 'word of mouth' for the school, the feedback of these 'new alums' is important.
- It also helps us gauge ourselves across important areas like Advising, Career Management Center, etc.
- This also gives us a clear idea about what is working and what is not for the students.
- Finally it helps us determine who the Promotors and Detractors are and in what numbers.

### Net Promotor Score

NPS stands for Net Promoter Score which is a metric used in customer experience programs. NPS measures the loyalty of customers to a company. NPS scores are measured with a single-question survey and reported with a number from the range -100 to +100, a higher score is desirable.

NPS® is often held up as the gold standard customer experience metric. First developed in 2003 by Bain and Company, it’s now used by millions of businesses to measure and track how they’re perceived by their customers. NPS scores determine segmenting between poor and positive feedback.

It measures customer perception based on one simple question:

# "How likely is it that you would recommend [Organization X/Product Y/Service Z] to a friend or colleague?"

Respondents give a rating between 0 (not at all likely) and 10 (extremely likely) and, depending on their response, customers fall into one of 3 categories to establish an NPS score:

- Promoters respond with a score of 9 or 10 and are typically loyal and enthusiastic customers.
- Passives respond with a score of 7 or 8. They are satisfied with your service but not happy enough to be considered promoters.
- Detractors respond with a score of 0 to 6. These are unhappy customers who are unlikely to buy from you again, and may even discourage others from buying from you.

### Makeup of the students

852 students took this survey, which contained 668 attributes. Each student was given the survey in the last 90 days of their program. Depending on the program, a student was asked anywhere between 80-100 questions. Below is the makeup of our respondents.

### Sense of belonging

It is important for us to know how our students feel when they graduate from the school. This particularly has a major role in their ability to come back to the school to contribute. This affects future relationships and hence is stressed up a lot. We do see that 36.18% of the students had a **Moderate Sense of Belonging**, whereas 26.81% had a **Strong Sense of Belonging**

### Overall Experience in JSOM

This is an important number for us as we gauge the academic and the overall satisfaction of the students. Each degree program is given a score out of 10 based on the students perception of the services provided

### Salary Changes

When students come into the program, they indicate their salaries. A program's success is gauuged by the salary the students' earn post graduation. Below is a snapshot of the Top 5 programs. the listed salary is in thousands.

### How has the school helped you?

This question helps us find the promotors in the best way as it gives us a clear insight into how students feel about the school. Here are the categories:
The range is from 'Not Differentiated' to 'Clearly Differentiated'

### But wait!

We have been witnessing that the students that are detractors are mostly the ones who are struggling across the board and complain across the board. We wanted to see if their average GPA is correlated to their satisfaction score. Post running a trendline analysis, the R-squared was a tiny number and the p-value was large enough to tell us that their was no significance found here

![Corr](https://github.com/gauravshekhar2003/dataviz/blob/master/assets/img/corr.png?raw=true)

Hence finally we tried to split our analysis into the 3 buckets that students are most familiar with:

- Advising
- Career Management Center
- Labs

Below is what we found out about these 3 very important services

### NPS for the School

As we would have imagined, the median NPS for the school was about 55, with the high of a 72. With students graduating in large numbers, this has been a trend over several semesters. The smaller programs deginitely had a larger NPS. Here is how the school looked like:

### Wrapping up

The more data we can collect and analyze alongside our NPS score, the more we’ll be able to understand what’s driving our student experience, allowing you to prioritize our improvements to have the biggest impact on our students.

Overall Factors that affect student satisfaction

- Support from individual departments
- Financial Support
- Support for placements
